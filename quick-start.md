### 2. Add your welcome message
This is what your participants will see when they first register to take part in your study. So it will probably thank them for registering, tell them a little about the research, such as when it takes place.

You don't have to do this, but you can add your own logo and background colours to the study.

# 4. Add your participants

# 5. Invite your participants
Now that your participants' email addresses have been added, you invite them to register for the study.

A good way to get a feel for MrQual is to invite yourself to be a participant, but using a different email address to that which you used to create your MrQual account. 

# 8. Monitor registration
You can check registration on the participant page. You may need to re-invite some people.
