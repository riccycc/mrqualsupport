Here are the usual problems that participants may experience...

----

# A participant has forgotten their username or password
They can just go to the usual login page, and at the bottom right there is a "Forgotten password".

----

# A participant says they cannot log in
This is almost always because they have not registered. You can tell by going to the setup area of your study, then clicking on the Participant tab. You should be able to see the status of the participant.

----

# A participant says they cannot see their previous answers
This is probably to do with pagination. When there are quite a few answers to a question they will automatically be put into pages, so some participants might think they have disappeared. 

----

# A participant says they cannot see the next question
This normally occurs if you are using Reveal sequentially, and it is usually because they have not actually answered the previous question. If this is not the problem it may be that the question is directed to a Room that they are not in.
